## Airport search

*  Meant to be an experimental, quick mockup, not particularly targeted at some user or situation
*  Used traditional HTML/CSS/jQuery
*  Only _query_ parameter was used
*  Development time between one day, one day and a half
*  Very clean and simple design (UX could and would be greatly improved with time)
*  Code should be clean and organized but it could be smaller and better planned (CSS and jQuery hide/show) - this is because I pretty much did everything at once, for the sake of time
*  Mobile wasn't a priority but it's adapted enough
